Just 3 seed airfoils with a smooth, homogeneous surface as a good starting point for new airfoils generated with Xoptfoil.
The airfoils were made out of splines using xflr5 (developer version with 7 decimals in airfoil .dat file) 
 
It's a good advice to use a seed airfoil which already has the desired reversals on top or bottom.


JX-Seed.dat 		Airfoil with no reversal on top or bottom side.
JX-Seed-Reload.dat	Airfoil with one reversal on bottom side - typical for reloaded airfoils
JX-Seed-S.dat		Airfoil with one reversal on top side for higher cm values as used for flying planks
