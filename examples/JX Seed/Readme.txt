Three seed airfoils with a smooth, homogeneous surface as a good starting point for new airfoils generated with Xoptfoil-JX. The airfoils were made with splines using xflr5.
 
Use a seed airfoil which already has the desired reversals on top or bottom:

JX-Seed.dat 		No reversal on top or bottom side.
JX-Seed-Reload.dat	One reversal on bottom side - typical for rearloaded airfoils
JX-Seed-S.dat		One reversal on top side for higher cm values as used for flying planks
