Medium: 

A complete set of strak airfoils is generated covering the range
RE*sqrt(cl) = 70000 - 190000.

Just a single input file is just for all these airfoils. The only variable is 
the reynolds number (type 2) which is passed to the input file via command line argument.

Like in the other example (Acro root) a little trick is used to ensure, that the point of 
best glide will be the samme for all strak airfoils (operating point 4).

Operating point 5 ensures to have cl-max along the wing.
