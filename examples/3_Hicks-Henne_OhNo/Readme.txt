An useful and important example of using Hicks-Henne shape functions in an "unchained" manner. 

Hicks_Henne shape functions are extremely powerful when it comes to more sophisticated airfoil optimization or airfoil design. The high number of degrees of freedom in shape manipulation allow highly optimized airfoils. 
The downside of this power are shape artifacts which quickly arise when no special care is taken to control the curvature. Especially in combination with "particle swarm optimization" it's practically certain that the particle swarm will find a mouse hole for strange artifacts...


Optimization Task: 

This is just a dummy task to demonstrate what can happen if Hicks-Henne is used without having possible difficulties in mind. Have a look at the input file for more hints and some tricks ...


Run the example by: 

-> Double click 'make-JX-bad.bat' to start the optimizer 
-> Double click 'visualize-JX-bad.bat' to start the visualizer for this optimization

... watch the geometry window of the visualizer to see how the curvature of the airfoil is running wild.

Enjoy!
