Build an airfoil strak, based on a given wing-planform-definition.

- It is necessary that you have python installed on your PC.
- It is recommended to use "Anaconda", that can be downloaded here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
- The scripts were teseted with Python 2.7

1. Specify planform-data in file "planformdata.txt" (json-file-format) or just take it like it is
   
   In the first step of the build-process, this file will be used as an input-data-file for "planform_creator.py".
   The script "planform_creator.py" will parse in the specified data, will read "plane_template.xml" and will
   then generate "plane.xml", which has an XFLR5-compatible format containing the data of the plane


2. Specify data for strak_machine.py in file "fx_strakdata_pre.txt" or "fx_strakdata_root.txt" or
   just take it like it is.
 
   There are two possible strategies for generating strak-airfoils: 
    a) each strak airfoil will be developed from the direct predecessor strak-airfoil
       -> "strategy" : "fromPredecessorAirfoil"
    b) each strak airfoil will be developed from the root-airfoil
       -> "strategy" : "fromRootAirfoil"
    - "fx_strakdata_pre.txt" has presets for the "strategy" : "fromPredecessorAirfoil"
    - "fx_strakdata_root.txt" has presets for the "strategy" : "fromRootAirfoil"


3. Edit file "make_fx_wing.bat"
   
   By default the batchfile will use "fx_strakdata_pre.txt". 
   If you would like to use "fx_strakdata_root.txt", then comment-out / comment-in the
   corresponding lines in the batchfile.


4. execute batchfile "make_f_wing.bat"

   - The planform of the wing will be created and will be shown in a separate window.

   - The file "plane.xml" will be created, which can be imported into XFLR5 
     (wing and plane design->plane->inport plane(s) from  xml files). 
     The plane will stay in a half-defined state unless all airfoils are imported into XFLR5
     (which of course is only possible after the generation of all airfoils)

   - The batch-file "make_fx_strak.bat" will be created, which contains all necessary command-lines
     for xoptfoil to genereate the strak-airfoils

   - The batch-file "make_fx_strak.bat" will be executed and the strak-airfoils will be generated
     Depending on your PC, it will take 10..30 minutes to generate one of the strak-airfoils,
     so the whole process may take several hours.
