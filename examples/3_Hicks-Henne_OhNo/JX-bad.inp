! An example using Hicks-Henne shape functions showing 
!    when some basic things are not taken into account ...
!
! Task: Optimize the seed airfoil to become the super airfoil
!
! Have a look in the visualizer to see what happens to the shape and the polar...
!
! Caution: With ongoing iterations the "optimized" airfoil
!          will destroy itself because Xfoil won't be able to evaluate 
!          this extreme shape

												!           This will lead to random local minima.
