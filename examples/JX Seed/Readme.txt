Seed airfoils with a smooth, homogeneous surface as a good starting point for new airfoils generated with Xoptfoil-JX. The airfoils were made with splines using xflr5.
 
Use the seed airfoil which already has the desired reversals on top or bottom:

JX-Seed.dat 			No reversal on top or bottom side.
JX-Seed-Reload.dat		One reversal on bottom side - typical for rearloaded airfoils
JX-Seed-Reflexed.dat		One reversal on top side for higher cm values as used for flying planks
JX-Seed-Reflexed-Small.dat	One mini reversal on top side for higher cm values as used for flying planks
JX-Seed-Symm.dat			Symmetric airfoil for elevator or rudder
